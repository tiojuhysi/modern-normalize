Dhag is not just a movie about caste and occupation, but also about the relationship between a mother and a son. Usha Jadhav, who plays the role of Yashoda, Krishna's mother, delivers a powerful performance as a woman who wants her son to have a better life than her husband, who was a cremator. She encourages Krishna to study and pursue his dreams, even if they are unconventional. She also faces the challenges of being a widow in a patriarchal society, and tries to protect her son from the harsh realities of their situation.
 
Hansraj Jagtap, who plays the role of Krishna, also impresses with his natural and nuanced portrayal of a boy who is torn between his mother's expectations and his own curiosity. He is fascinated by fire and death, and wants to learn more about the rituals and beliefs associated with them. He also develops a friendship with a girl from a higher caste, who introduces him to a different world. He struggles to balance his loyalty to his mother and his desire to explore new possibilities.
