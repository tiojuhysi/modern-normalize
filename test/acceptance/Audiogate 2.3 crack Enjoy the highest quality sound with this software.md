## What is Audiogate 2.3?
 
Audiogate 2.3 is a software application that can convert, edit, and play audio files in different formats and resolutions. It supports MP3, AAC, WAV, FLAC, and DSD formats, as well as sample rates from 44.1 kHz to 192 kHz and bit depths from 16 bit to 24 bit. It can also create playlists that contain mixed formats and resolutions, and apply various effects and filters to enhance the sound quality.
 
Audiogate 2.3 is especially optimized for playing DSD files, which are the highest-quality audio format available today. DSD stands for Direct Stream Digital, and it is a format that uses a single bit to represent the amplitude of the sound wave at a very high sampling rate (usually 2.8 MHz or 5.6 MHz). This results in a very natural and realistic sound that is close to the original analog source.

To use Audiogate 2.3, you need to download it from the KORG website[^1^] and install it on your computer.
