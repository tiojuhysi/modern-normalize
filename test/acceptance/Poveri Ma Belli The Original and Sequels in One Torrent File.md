Risi had a keen eye for the social changes and contradictions of the Italian society in the 1950s and 1960s, and used comedy as a way to criticize and expose them. Risi also had a great sense of rhythm and timing, and knew how to balance comedy and drama.

The film also captures the beauty and charm of Rome, with its monuments, squares, fountains and streets. The film is a tribute to the eternal city and its people, who are poor but handsome, indeed.
